# hello-world

Hello World! Repetitive, I know. But, what else to you say to the world upon introducting yourself?!?  :)
Okay, well, I'm Ami and I'm learning to use GitHub - primarily because I want to work there. I've got light coding experience from back in the 90s, but not much since then ... so, I'm a little rusty.
I'll go through this tutorial and then maybe, hopefuly, find another real-world project I can use GitHub for to keep practicing my skills.
Goodbye World!
